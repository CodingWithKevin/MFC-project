            <p class="paragraph"><b>WE BELIEVE</b> in marriage as an indissoluble institution as taught by our Lord Jesus Christ (Mt 19:6). WE BELIEVE that God created marriage primarily for love between man and woman, and for the procreation and proper rearing of children.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><b>WE BELIEVE</b> that God created man and wife with equal personal worth and dignity. WE BELIEVE that God ordained order in the family by giving the man the role as head of the family and the woman as helpmate and support, which roles best
                express their complementarity.</p>

                members of society.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><b>WE BELIEVE</b> that the family, in practicing the gospel message, shares in the life and mission of the Churchâ€”through prayers, evangelization, and service to others, especially the poor.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><b>WE BELIEVE</b> that Christian family renewal can best be achieved by inviting Jesus to be the Lord of our homes, by allowing the power of the Holy Spirit to lead our family lives, and through the full use of all spiritual gifts at our disposal.</p>
